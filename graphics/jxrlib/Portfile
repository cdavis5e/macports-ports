description         Library for manipulating JPEG XR images

long_description    JPEG XR is an approved ISO/IEC International standard. Its \
                    official designation is ISO/IEC 29199-2. JPEG XR started \
                    its life in Microsoft Research. It publicly first appeared \
                    as the HD Photo format in Windows Vista. For web \
                    developers, JPEG XR has a large number of interesting \
                    features, including better compression, a lossless \
                    compression mode, alpha channel support, extended bit \
                    depths, progressive decode, and advanced decoding features \
                    such as tile-based layout.
